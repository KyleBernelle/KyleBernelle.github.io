**Known Issues**

* **You must be signed into Steam when playtesting in the edito**r, or else the editor will crash when entering the character select screen
* The classes and structs specified in the Lua API documentation still use their unreal prefix for classes and structs in some places (ARivalsGameplayEntity instead of just RivalsGameplayEntity), but to reference those types in the lua code itself (except for enums), use the name without the prefix

  * Example: **RivalsGamplayEntity**

* Workshop character select doesnâ€™t work well with a controller right now

  * **Use the mouse cursor to select a workshop item**

* In the editor, if the character definition asset for a modded character is not opened (example: Char\_ClairenLua), then playing in editor will not show the character in the workshop item list

  * To get around this, **open the character definition asset for the character to test in the editor before hitting play**

* It is possible to accidentally pass the wrong type into the arguments of a function from lua, and there will be no obvious feedback that there is an issue

  * This can cause seemingly random crashes to occur, or even cause a function to appear to do nothing

* For functions that take a const interface as an argument (notably const RivalsDamageInterface\*), an issue can occur where the reference to that object does not get passed in correctly
